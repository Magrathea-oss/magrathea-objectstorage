# Magrathea ObjectStorage Test Report

Updated: 2026-06-14

> ⚠️ **Report status: EVIDENCE-ONLY / NOT A COMPLETION CLAIM**
>
> This report reflects point-in-time validation evidence and **must not be read as implementation completeness**.
> - The `111/111` route count (referenced elsewhere) is a mapped-surface inventory only, not semantic completion.
> - AWS CLI standalone results (46 passed / 82 failed) are from a run where the server was not started; most failures are connection errors (exit code 254), not logic failures.
> - Current Cucumber/requirements counts: legacy WebTestClient **239 passed**; existing AWS CLI parity suite **26 passed**; isolated Phase 2 WebTestClient requirements **11 examples total, 7 passed, 4 `@awscli` examples excluded/skipped**; dedicated storage-engine AWS CLI Phase 2 validation **4 scenarios/examples passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped**; Phase 5 WebTestClient semantic compatibility requirements **25 scenarios/tests passed, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skipped**; Phase 6 storage-engine domain distributed-readiness gate **164 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skipped**; domain quality bounded first pass **storage-engine-domain 172 tests and object-store-domain 292 tests passed**; runtime correctness bounded first pass targeted module gate and latest full Maven gate **passed**.
> - Phase 2 filesystem reliability is **implemented-and-validated for the declared Phase 2 scope**. This does not claim distributed readiness, broader S3 semantic completion, or later-phase production readiness.
> - Phase 3 reactive pipeline is **implemented-not-e2e-validated**: unit/application validation passed for REQ-PIPELINE-001 through REQ-PIPELINE-006, but no Phase 3 WebTestClient, AWS CLI, or end-to-end Cucumber validation has been executed yet.
> - Phase 5 S3 semantic compatibility is **implemented-and-validated for 24 WebTestClient scenarios** and **implemented-not-e2e-validated for REQ-S3-002-C multipart restart/durability** because that scenario uses a direct same-directory filesystem repository probe rather than a full process/Spring restart. Phase 5 AWS CLI validation has not been newly added.
> - Phase 6 distributed readiness is **implemented-not-e2e-validated** for the modeled domain scope only. It is unit validated through distributed-readiness domain tests, but real replication execution, networked membership, healing/rebalance job runners, actual multi-node durability, and full e2e multi-node validation remain absent. Distributed production readiness is not claimed.
> - **JaCoCo is the current coverage baseline.** Clover/OpenClover is optional/legacy.
>
> A semantic S3 coverage matrix is being built as part of the correction plan (see `PLAN.md` → *S3 API Semantic Completion Plan*).

## Current Verified Results

| Scope | Evidence | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Phase 2 filesystem reliability (`storage-engine-reactive-infrastructure`, `s3-reactive-api-adapter`) | `mvn -B -pl s3-reactive-api-adapter -am test -Dsurefire.failIfNoSpecifiedTests=false`; `mvn -B test`; isolated Phase 2 WebTestClient requirements runner; dedicated storage-engine AWS CLI Phase 2 validation | Targeted adapter gate PASS; full Maven test PASS; Phase 2 WebTestClient: 11 examples, 7 passed, 4 `@awscli` examples excluded/skipped; Phase 2 AWS CLI: 4 scenarios/examples, 4 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped | Implemented evidence covers atomic chunk temp-file/fsync/rename writes with SHA-256 sidecar checksums, atomic manifest temp-file/fsync/rename writes with checksum trailer, read-time chunk/manifest checksum verification, `FileSystemRecoveryScanner` reporting/quarantine/idempotence, S3 XML mapping for storage-engine integrity errors, disabled-by-default write fault injection for interrupted chunk/manifest write tests, and defaulting `null`/blank storage class to `STANDARD` for storage-engine `PutObject`. Phase 2 is implemented-and-validated for declared scope only; distributed readiness, broader S3 semantic completion, and later phases remain pending. |
| Phase 3 reactive pipeline (`storage-engine-reactive-application`) | `s3-reactive-api-adapter/src/test/features/requirements/phase-3-reactive-pipeline.feature`; `mvn -B -pl storage-engine-reactive-application -am test`; `mvn -B -pl s3-reactive-api-adapter -am test -Dsurefire.failIfNoSpecifiedTests=false`; `mvn -B test` | Storage-engine reactive application gate PASS: 159 total, 159 passed, 0 failed/errors/skipped. Targeted adapter gate PASS: 814 total, 803 passed, 0 failed/errors, 11 skipped. Full Maven test PASS: 833 total, 822 passed, 0 failed/errors, 11 skipped. | `@implemented-not-e2e-validated`: validates staged read/write pipeline behavior at unit/application level only. No Phase 3 WebTestClient, AWS CLI, or end-to-end Cucumber validation has been executed yet. No Phase 4 metrics/tracing adapters are included. |
| Phase 5 S3 semantic compatibility (`s3-reactive-api-adapter`) | Requirement feature: `s3-reactive-api-adapter/src/test/features/requirements/phase-5-s3-semantic-compatibility.feature`; runner: `s3-reactive-api-adapter/src/test/java/com/example/magrathea/s3api/cucumber/requirements/Phase5S3SemanticCompatibilityRequirementsCucumberTest.java`; step glue: `s3-reactive-api-adapter/src/test/java/com/example/magrathea/s3api/cucumber/requirements/Phase5S3SemanticCompatibilitySteps.java`; full gate: `mvn -B test --no-transfer-progress` | Phase 5 WebTestClient runner PASS: 25 scenarios/tests, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skipped. Full Maven validation PASS / BUILD SUCCESS, 0 failures/errors. | `@implemented-and-validated` for 24 Phase 5 WebTestClient scenarios. REQ-S3-002-C is `@implemented-not-e2e-validated` because multipart uploaded-part durability is validated through WebTestClient plus a direct same-directory filesystem repository probe, not a full process/Spring restart. REQ-S3-007 scenarios pass as explicit `@not-implemented` or `@config-only` classification for versioning, object lock, and lifecycle; no enforcement is claimed. No Phase 5 AWS CLI runner has been newly added. |
| Phase 6 distributed readiness (`storage-engine-domain`) | Requirement feature: `s3-reactive-api-adapter/src/test/features/requirements/phase-6-distributed-readiness.feature`; domain implementation: `storage-engine-domain/src/main/java/com/example/magrathea/storageengine/domain/distributed/`; tests: `DistributedPlacementPlannerTest`, `QuorumPolicyTest`, `AntiEntropyPlannerTest`, `RebalancePlannerTest`, `DistributedReadinessReporterTest`; gates: `mvn -B -pl storage-engine-domain test --no-transfer-progress`, `mvn -B test --no-transfer-progress` | Storage-engine domain gate PASS: 164 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skipped. Full Maven gate PASS / BUILD SUCCESS: 883 test cases observed, 0 failures, 0 errors, 11 skipped. | `@implemented-not-e2e-validated` for modeled domain/unit scope only. Deterministic placement, health-aware membership decisions, quorum decisions, anti-entropy/healing plans, rebalance plans, and readiness classification are modeled and unit validated. Real networked membership, real replication execution, healing/rebalance job runners, actual multi-node durability, and full e2e multi-node validation remain absent. No public storage-engine object API endpoints were added; S3 object behavior remains exposed through S3-compatible APIs only. |
| Domain quality bounded first pass (`storage-engine-domain`, `object-store-domain`) | Tests: `object-store-domain/src/test/java/.../DomainCollectionImmutabilityTest.java`, `storage-engine-domain/src/test/java/.../DomainCollectionImmutabilityTest.java`, and additional `StoredObjectTest` restore invariant coverage; gates: `mvn -B -pl storage-engine-domain,object-store-domain test --no-transfer-progress`, `mvn -B test --no-transfer-progress` | Targeted domain gate PASS: storage-engine-domain 172 tests and object-store-domain 292 tests, 0 failures/errors. Full Maven gate PASS / BUILD SUCCESS. | Bounded first pass only: validates defensive collection copies/immutable exposure and strengthened `StoredObject` invariants. `StoredObject` remains mutable through controlled lifecycle methods; duplicate/ambiguous encryption class names, explicit `Bucket` deleted terminal state, and broad immutable aggregate/lifecycle redesign remain open. |
| Runtime correctness bounded first pass (PLAN section D) | Tests strengthened for `StorageEngineReactiveS3ObjectRepository`, `FileSystemManifestRepository`, and filesystem scheduling; gates: `mvn -B -pl object-store-reactive-repository-storage-engine-infrastructure,storage-engine-reactive-infrastructure,s3-reactive-api-adapter,bootstrap-application -am test --no-transfer-progress`, `mvn -B test --no-transfer-progress` | Targeted module gate PASS / BUILD SUCCESS. Full Maven gate PASS / BUILD SUCCESS. | Evidence covers real storage-engine repository read-through via manifest reference and `orchestrator.read(...)`, manifest round-trip of declared upload checksum and multipart part checksum results, and `BlockingFileSystemOperation` bounded-elastic scheduling for blocking filesystem work. This does not close section D: S3 handler full-body accumulation and multipart part body persistence/final object assembly remain open. |
| Gherkin requirements ARC42 appendix (`docs/arc42/generated/gherkin-requirements.adoc`) | `python3 scripts/generate-gherkin-requirements-appendix.py --check` | PASS: generated appendix is fresh; 65 scenarios from 6 feature files | Documentation-generation evidence only. The report summarizes explicit scenario tags and does not invent implementation or validation results. |
| Source/build hygiene gates (PLAN section A safe first pass) | `mvn -B validate --no-transfer-progress`; `bash scripts/check-source-hygiene.sh` | PASS / BUILD SUCCESS; PASS | Evidence covers Maven validation and the source hygiene script that fails on source-tree `.class` files, root `com/`, root `META-INF`, and generated `META-INF/maven` outside ignored build output directories. `.gitignore`, `.dockerignore`, root Maven plugin/coverage-profile documentation, and Dockerfile `wget` runtime dependency were updated. Docker compose config/full Docker build validation was not run because `docker` is unavailable; duplicate module-level `coverage` profile consolidation in `bootstrap-application/pom.xml` remains pending. |
| Module/layering architecture guard (PLAN section B) | `scripts/check-module-layering.sh`; `mvn -B validate --no-transfer-progress`; `mvn -B test --no-transfer-progress` | PASS; PASS / BUILD SUCCESS; PASS / BUILD SUCCESS | The guard blocks application-to-infrastructure dependency inversions for object-store, storage-engine, and repository-application modules; preserves explicit `objectstore`/`objectstorage` package naming scan roots while the naming inconsistency remains; and checks explicit backend profile separation. Existing backend selection context tests still assert default in-memory beans versus storage-engine beans and fail-fast backend conflicts. Full Maven build succeeded after the ARC42 docs conversion fix changed generated appendix output from `NOTE:` admonition syntax to a plain paragraph. This is bounded first-pass evidence, not complete architecture cleanup or an ArchUnit/Java test claim. |
| Phase 5 domain planning (`storage-engine-domain`) | Commit `b0a5f74`; `PersistencePlannerMinioStandardTest` | 152 tests passing, 0 failures | Verifies deterministic `MINIO_STANDARD` persistence planning in the domain model. |
| Phase 5 YAML catalogs and MINIO_STANDARD integration (`storage-engine-reactive-infrastructure`) | Commit `0ec84cf`; `MinioStandardIntegrationTest` | 26 tests passing, 0 failures | Verifies YAML catalog/device integration and `MINIO_STANDARD` selection with S3 storage class `STANDARD`, dedup disabled, EC planning `4 data / 2 parity`, replication factor `1`, compression disabled, and encryption disabled by default; storage-engine runtime read/write wiring and physical EC shard placement remain pending for Phase 6/7. |
| Phase 8 backend Admin API (`admin-api-adapter`) | `mvn -B -pl admin-api-adapter -am test`; `AdminRouterTest` | 9 tests passing, 0 failures, build success | Verifies configuration-as-code/read-only admin catalog behavior for policies/devices/disk sets, structured validation responses for `POST /admin/storage-policies/validate`, non-persistence of validation, and runtime rejection of policy mutations. |
| Section E storage-engine configuration bounded first pass | `YamlStoragePolicyCatalogTest` (14), `YamlStorageDeviceCatalogTest` (10), `YamlDiskSetCatalogTest` (12), `MinioStandardIntegrationTest` (2), `StorageEngineMissingExternalConfigTest` (1), `StorageEngineBackendContextTest` (3), `AdminRouterTest` (9); `mvn -B test` PASS | 52 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors | `@implemented-and-validated` for declared Section E scope. YAML catalogs validate duplicate IDs, malformed YAML, domain-invalid configs, zero-device disk sets, blank device references, unresolved device references. MINIO_STANDARD loaded from YAML produces deterministic EC `4/2` plans. Storage-engine backend fails fast on missing config. Mutually exclusive `storage-engine` vs `single-node` profile selection proven. Admin API uses same catalog beans (unit-level). Gaps: no full Spring Boot integration test for admin API with real YAML catalogs; physical EC shard placement and multi-node topology remain modeled only. |
| Phase 1 upload reliability bootstrap (`bootstrap-application`) | `StorageEngineRestartSafetyTest` (1), `StorageEngineMultiChunkUploadTest` (1), `StorageEngineHttpReadAfterWriteTest` (2); `mvn -B test` PASS | 4 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors | `@implemented-not-e2e-validated`: REQ-UPLOAD-001 restart safety proven by two-context SpringApplicationBuilder test; REQ-UPLOAD-002 manifest reload proven by fresh repository constructor; REQ-UPLOAD-003 bounded-memory streaming proven by chunk-file count assertions; REQ-UPLOAD-005 read-after-write proven by filesystem artifact inspection. REQ-UPLOAD-004 and REQ-UPLOAD-006 remain `@not-implemented`. No Cucumber runner glue exists for `phase-1-upload-storage-engine.feature` scenarios. |
| Phase 9 AWS CLI object CRUD, bucket operations, metadata/tagging, and multipart increment (`s3-reactive-api-adapter`) | Production commits `9ff5a08`, `b2c333c`, `a03bc4a`; test commits `94f3e47`, `cdbcc9d`, `a03bc4a`; `AwsCliCucumberTest` + legacy `ObjectStoreCucumberTest` | 265 Cucumber examples, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skipped | Targeted AWS CLI Cucumber has 26 scenarios total: all run, 0 skipped. Legacy WebTestClient Cucumber has 239 scenarios passing. This row does not include the isolated Phase 2 WebTestClient runner or the dedicated storage-engine AWS CLI Phase 2 validation. |

### Phase 2 Filesystem Reliability Scenario Status

| Requirement | Scenario | Validation mode | Status | Notes |

| REQ-FS-006 | Concurrent PUT of the same key | Isolated Phase 2 WebTestClient requirements runner; dedicated storage-engine AWS CLI Phase 2 validation | ✅ Passed | Concurrency scenario passed for the same object key. |
| Phase 2 mode summary | WebTestClient and AWS CLI declared scope | WebTestClient + AWS CLI | ✅ Passed for declared scope | WebTestClient: 11 examples total, 7 passed, 4 `@awscli` examples skipped/excluded. AWS CLI: 4 scenarios/examples, 4 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped. |

### Phase 3 Reactive Pipeline Unit/Application Requirement Status

| Requirement | Scenario | Validation mode | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| REQ-PIPELINE-001 | Write pipeline stage order/events | Unit/application validation in `storage-engine-reactive-application` | ✅ Passed | Verifies staged write execution and event ordering. |
| REQ-PIPELINE-002 | Bounded demand/backpressure/no whole-object aggregation | Unit/application validation in `storage-engine-reactive-application` | ✅ Passed | Verifies bounded demand and avoids global full-object aggregation in production pipeline behavior. |
| REQ-PIPELINE-003 | Read pipeline manifest chunk order | Unit/application validation in `storage-engine-reactive-application` | ✅ Passed | Verifies read pipeline emits chunks in manifest order. |

| REQ-PIPELINE-006 | Instrumentation event metadata/correlation/no payload leakage | Unit/application validation in `storage-engine-reactive-application` | ✅ Passed | Verifies correlation metadata is emitted without leaking object payload bytes. |
| Phase 3 mode summary | Reactive pipeline requirements | Unit/application only | ⚠️ Implemented-not-e2e-validated | No Phase 3 WebTestClient, AWS CLI, or end-to-end Cucumber validation has been executed yet. |

### Phase 5 S3 Semantic Compatibility Requirement Status

Evidence:
- Requirement source: `s3-reactive-api-adapter/src/test/features/requirements/phase-5-s3-semantic-compatibility.feature`.
- WebTestClient runner: `s3-reactive-api-adapter/src/test/java/com/example/magrathea/s3api/cucumber/requirements/Phase5S3SemanticCompatibilityRequirementsCucumberTest.java`.
- Step glue: `s3-reactive-api-adapter/src/test/java/com/example/magrathea/s3api/cucumber/requirements/Phase5S3SemanticCompatibilitySteps.java`.
- Phase 5 WebTestClient validation passed: 25 scenarios/tests, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skipped.
- Full Maven validation passed: `mvn -B test --no-transfer-progress` BUILD SUCCESS, 0 failures/errors.

| Requirement | Scenario area | Validation mode | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| REQ-S3-001 | PutObject/HeadObject ETag format and consistency | WebTestClient Cucumber | ✅ Implemented-and-validated | RFC-compatible quoted lowercase MD5 ETags are computed and persisted through the S3 object `etag` domain field and repository translators. |
| REQ-S3-002 | UploadPart and CompleteMultipartUpload ETag semantics | WebTestClient Cucumber | ✅ Implemented-and-validated for normal multipart ETag semantics | UploadPart returns real part MD5 ETags; CompleteMultipartUpload returns multipart ETag with the `-{partCount}` suffix. |
| REQ-S3-002-C | Multipart uploaded-part durability probe | WebTestClient plus direct filesystem same-directory repository probe | ⚠️ Implemented-not-e2e-validated | Filesystem-backed multipart upload repository exists for durable multipart state, but this validation is not a full process/Spring restart e2e scenario. |
| REQ-S3-003 | Byte-range GET and unsatisfiable range | WebTestClient Cucumber | ✅ Implemented-and-validated | Range GET returns 206 Partial Content with `Content-Range`; unsatisfiable ranges return 416 `InvalidRange`. |
| REQ-S3-004 | Conditional GET/HEAD headers | WebTestClient Cucumber | ✅ Implemented-and-validated | Covers `If-Match`, `If-None-Match`, `If-Modified-Since`, and `If-Unmodified-Since`. |
| REQ-S3-005 | CopyObject ETag | WebTestClient Cucumber | ✅ Implemented-and-validated | CopyObject returns the destination ETag instead of a placeholder. |
| REQ-S3-006 | Object tagging lifecycle and inline `x-amz-tagging` | WebTestClient Cucumber | ✅ Implemented-and-validated | Object tags persist through the S3 object `objectTags` domain field and object tagging endpoints. |
| REQ-S3-007 | Versioning, object lock, and lifecycle classification | WebTestClient Cucumber | ✅ Validated as not-implemented/config-only classification | Scenarios intentionally document unsupported/config-only behavior. Versioning, object-lock, lifecycle, and replication enforcement are not claimed complete. |
| Phase 5 mode summary | Declared Phase 5 S3 semantic compatibility scope | WebTestClient only | ✅/⚠️ Honest declared-scope result | 24 scenarios are `@implemented-and-validated`; REQ-S3-002-C is `@implemented-not-e2e-validated`; no Phase 5 AWS CLI runner was newly added despite some scenarios carrying `@awscli-required`. |

Implemented outputs recorded for Phase 5: RFC-compatible quoted lowercase MD5 ETags for PutObject/HeadObject; ETag and object tag persistence in the S3 object domain model and repository translators; Range GET and conditional GET/HEAD behavior; CopyObject destination ETag propagation; real multipart part/final ETags; filesystem-backed multipart upload state; and explicit unsupported/config-only S3 responses.

### Phase 6 Distributed Readiness Modeled Domain Requirement Status

Evidence:
- Requirement source: `s3-reactive-api-adapter/src/test/features/requirements/phase-6-distributed-readiness.feature`.
- Production domain implementation: `storage-engine-domain/src/main/java/com/example/magrathea/storageengine/domain/distributed/`.
- Semantic unit tests: `DistributedPlacementPlannerTest`, `QuorumPolicyTest`, `AntiEntropyPlannerTest`, `RebalancePlannerTest`, and `DistributedReadinessReporterTest`.
- Targeted validation passed: `mvn -B -pl storage-engine-domain test --no-transfer-progress` — 164 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skipped.
- Full validation passed: `mvn -B test --no-transfer-progress` — BUILD SUCCESS; 883 test cases observed, 0 failures, 0 errors, 11 skipped.

| Requirement | Scenario area | Validation mode | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| REQ-DIST-001 | Modeled placement across failure domains and insufficient-domain failure | Domain/unit validation | ⚠️ Implemented-not-e2e-validated | Deterministic modeled topology/placement planner selects replicas across nodes and failure domains and reports insufficient-domain failures. |
| REQ-DIST-002 | Write/read quorum and integrity-aware read failure | Domain/unit validation | ⚠️ Implemented-not-e2e-validated | Explicit write/read quorum decision model exists, including integrity-aware read quorum behavior for corrupt or missing replicas. |
| REQ-DIST-003 | Health-aware membership placement and exclusions | Domain/unit validation | ⚠️ Implemented-not-e2e-validated | Placement uses `HEALTHY`, `DEGRADED`, and `DOWN` node states with explicit exclusion and risk reasons. |
| REQ-DIST-004 | Anti-entropy findings and planned healing tasks | Domain/unit validation | ⚠️ Implemented-not-e2e-validated | Anti-entropy planner produces missing, corrupt, and unrecoverable findings plus planned healing tasks. |
| REQ-DIST-005 | Safe rebalance planning and failed-copy retry classification | Domain/unit validation | ⚠️ Implemented-not-e2e-validated | Rebalance planner produces observable move plans and failed-copy retry results without reducing quorum. |
| REQ-DIST-006 | Readiness classification that avoids distributed-production claims | Domain/unit validation | ⚠️ Implemented-not-e2e-validated | Readiness reporter never claims `distributed-production-ready` for local, simulated, or default filesystem mode and lists missing capabilities. |
| Phase 6 mode summary | Declared distributed-readiness modeled domain scope | Domain/unit only | ⚠️ Modeled/unit validated only | All Phase 6 scenarios are modeled domain/unit validated only. Real networked membership, replication execution, durable multi-node manifest publication, healing/rebalance job runners, actual multi-node durability, and WebTestClient/AWS CLI/full e2e multi-node validation remain absent. |

Implemented outputs recorded for Phase 6: pure domain distributed-readiness model for topology/node health, placement decisions, quorum policy, replica observations, anti-entropy findings/healing tasks, rebalance plans/task results, and readiness reports. No public storage-engine object API endpoints were added; S3 object behavior remains exposed through S3-compatible APIs only. Distributed production readiness remains not achieved.

### AWS CLI Test Status

| Feature | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Legacy WebTestClient scenarios (239) | ✅ Passing | Existing Cucumber via Java WebTestClient (`@webclient` tag). |
| Phase 2 WebTestClient requirements | ✅ 11 total, 7 passed, 4 `@awscli` examples excluded/skipped | Isolated Phase 2 runner validates REQ-FS-001 through REQ-FS-006 for the WebTestClient-required scope, including interrupted chunk/manifest write fault injection, corruption detection, recovery scanning, and concurrency scenarios. |
| Phase 2 storage-engine AWS CLI requirements | ✅ 4 total, 4 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped | Dedicated AWS CLI validation passed for REQ-FS-003, REQ-FS-004, REQ-FS-006 different keys, and REQ-FS-006 same key. |
| Phase 5 AWS CLI requirements | ⚠️ Not newly added | Phase 5 evidence is WebTestClient-only; do not treat `@awscli-required` tags in the Phase 5 feature as newly validated AWS CLI coverage. |
| AWS CLI Cucumber scenarios | ⚠️ 26 existing parity scenarios, all run, 0 skipped | Object CRUD basics (including slash-containing keys), bucket operations (create, list, head, location, versioning, delete, and failure cases), ACL/tagging (bucket and object read/write/CRUD), object attributes, and multipart upload lifecycle (initiate/upload/complete/abort/list) now have targeted AWS CLI coverage; full parity with WebTestClient canonical scenarios remains incomplete beyond the declared Phase 2 AWS CLI scope. |
| `test-aws-cli.sh` standalone | ⚠️ 46/82 passed | Standalone script; most failures are connection errors (server not running at test time), not logic failures. |

## Maven Surefire Results

> The detailed module-level table below is the previous Phase 10 breakdown. The latest full Maven gate after the domain quality first pass, `mvn -B test --no-transfer-progress`, passed with BUILD SUCCESS; the handoff did not provide a fresh aggregate test-case count for that full run. Earlier full-run evidence observed **883 test cases, 0 failures, 0 errors, 11 skipped**. Use the Summary and phase/domain-quality sections above for current validation evidence.

## Coverage

**JaCoCo** is the current coverage baseline. Reports are generated by `mvn -Pcoverage test jacoco:report` under `target/site/jacoco/`.

**Clover/OpenClover** is optional/legacy. Report HTML (if generated): `target/site/clover/index.html`

| Metric | Notes |
|---|---|
| JaCoCo | Phase 10 results in table below and in the Phase 10 Quality Gates section |
| Clover (optional/legacy) | Run `mvn -Pcoverage clover:setup test clover:aggregate clover:clover` to generate |

### Phase 10 JaCoCo Results (`mvn -Pcoverage test jacoco:report`)

| Module | Instruction Coverage | Branch Coverage |
|---|---:|---:|
| object-store-domain | 81% | 64% |
| storage-engine-reactive-application | 82% | 74% |
| s3-reactive-api-adapter | 77% | 30% |
| storage-engine-reactive-infrastructure | 54% | 42% |
| storage-engine-domain | 59% | 45% |
| admin-api-adapter | 69% | 46% |
| bootstrap-application | 58% | 29% |
| object-store-reactive-application | 18% | 20% |
| object-store-reactive-repository-storage-engine-infrastructure | 13% | 5% |

> **Note:** Low coverage in `object-store-reactive-application` (18% instruction / 20% branch) and `object-store-reactive-repository-storage-engine-infrastructure` (13% instruction / 5% branch) reflects that these modules primarily contain port interfaces and thin adapters where runtime behaviour is exercised through integration/Cucumber tests that run against the assembled application rather than isolated units.

## Previous Phase 10 Quality Gates

**Date:** 2026-06-12 &nbsp; **HEAD:** `351d088`

> This section is retained as historical Phase 10 evidence. The latest counted aggregate before Phase 5 is the Phase 3 validation snapshot above: `mvn -B test` passed with 833 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors, and 11 skipped. The supplied Phase 5 full Maven gate also passed (`mvn -B test --no-transfer-progress`, BUILD SUCCESS, 0 failures/errors), with no restated total count.

### `mvn validate`

✅ BUILD SUCCESS — all module POMs valid.

### `mvn test` — Full Multi-Module Run (previous Phase 10 snapshot)

Historical Phase 10 quality gates passed with no failures, errors, or skipped tests. The latest supplied full Maven gate for this report, `mvn -B test --no-transfer-progress`, passed with BUILD SUCCESS and 0 failures/errors; the total test count was not restated in the supplied Phase 5 evidence. The Phase 2 WebTestClient skipped/excluded examples are `@awscli` examples covered by the dedicated AWS CLI validation where applicable, not fault-injection validation gaps. Phase 3 reactive pipeline validation is unit/application only and is not yet WebTestClient/AWS CLI/e2e validated. Phase 5 semantic compatibility validation is WebTestClient-only, with no newly added Phase 5 AWS CLI runner.

## S3 Semantic Coverage Matrix

> This table classifies each S3 API family by semantic status, not route count.
> **Route mapped** = HTTP route exists; **Stateful behavior** = creates/reads/updates/deletes durable state with observable follow-up; **AWS CLI scenario** = verified via AWS CLI Cucumber or `test-aws-cli.sh`; **Storage-engine scenario** = verified against storage-engine backend; **Semantic status** = overall classification.

### Current Evidence-Based Family Classification

| Family | Operation (examples) | Route mapped | Stateful behavior | AWS CLI scenario | Storage-engine scenario | Semantic status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Object CRUD | PutObject, GetObject, HeadObject, DeleteObject, CopyObject, Range GET, conditional GET/HEAD | Yes | Partial — WebTestClient-validated ETag, range, conditional, copy, and object state semantics for declared Phase 5 scope | Partial pass: existing AWS CLI increment covers put default headers, get content, head, delete, idempotent delete, `STANDARD` storage class via object attributes, and slash-containing object keys; no new Phase 5 AWS CLI runner | Absent | Partial / WebTestClient semantic coverage for declared Phase 5 subset | Phase 5 validates quoted lowercase MD5 ETags, ETag persistence, Range GET 206/416 behavior, conditional GET/HEAD headers, and CopyObject destination ETag through WebTestClient. Storage-engine backend and Phase 5 AWS CLI validation remain absent. |
| Bucket baseline | CreateBucket, HeadBucket, DeleteBucket, ListBuckets, ListObjects, ListObjectsV2 | Yes | Partial — in-memory only | Partial pass: AWS CLI bucket operations increment covers create-bucket, list-buckets, head-bucket, get-bucket-location, get-bucket-versioning, put-bucket-versioning, delete-bucket, duplicate-bucket 409, head-bucket 404, delete-bucket 404, list-objects, and list-objects-v2 | Absent | Stubbed / Partial | Bucket create/head/location/versioning/delete and failure cases now have targeted AWS CLI Cucumber coverage; prefix/delimiter edge cases, continuation tokens, and storage-engine indexes remain unverified |
| Multipart upload | CreateMultipartUpload, UploadPart, CompleteMultipartUpload, AbortMultipartUpload, ListParts, ListMultipartUploads | Yes | Partial — WebTestClient validates real part MD5 ETags, multipart final ETag suffix, and filesystem-backed multipart state probe | Partial pass: AWS CLI Cucumber third increment covers full lifecycle (initiate/upload-parts/list-parts/complete), abort, and list multipart uploads; no new Phase 5 AWS CLI runner | Absent | Partial / WebTestClient semantic coverage for declared Phase 5 subset | UploadPart returns real part MD5 ETags and CompleteMultipartUpload returns `-{partCount}` multipart ETags. Multipart restart/durability is implemented-not-e2e-validated because the durability check is a same-directory filesystem repository probe, not a full process/Spring restart. |
| Bucket configuration | CORS, Lifecycle, Website, Logging, Notification, Replication, Encryption, Versioning, Tagging, etc. | Yes | Partial — config storage or explicit unsupported/config-only classification only | Failing in stale standalone script; no new Phase 5 AWS CLI runner | Absent | Config-only / Stubbed / Not implemented where explicitly declared | Phase 5 validates explicit unsupported/config-only classification for versioning, object lock, and lifecycle. No background job execution or enforcement is claimed. |
| Object metadata/tagging/ACL | PutObjectTagging, GetObjectTagging, GetObjectAttributes, PutObjectAcl, GetObjectAcl, PutBucketTagging, GetBucketTagging, DeleteBucketTagging, PutBucketAcl, GetBucketAcl | Yes | Partial — object tags persist in the S3 object domain model for Phase 5; ACL grant enforcement remains stubbed/partial | Partial pass: AWS CLI third increment covers bucket ACL read/write, object ACL read/write, bucket tagging CRUD, object tagging CRUD, and object attributes (ETag + ObjectSize); no new Phase 5 AWS CLI runner | Absent | Partial / WebTestClient semantic coverage for object tagging | Phase 5 validates object tag persistence through `objectTags`, object tagging endpoints, and inline `x-amz-tagging`. Storage-engine backend remains unverified; ACL grant enforcement remains stubbed. |
| Versioning/delete markers | ListObjectVersions, versioned GET/HEAD/DELETE | Yes | Explicit unsupported/not-implemented classification for Phase 5 scope | Failing in stale standalone script; no new Phase 5 AWS CLI runner | Absent | Not implemented / Stubbed | Phase 5 passing scenarios document unsupported/not-implemented classification. Version IDs, delete markers, latest-version resolution, and enforcement remain unimplemented. |

### AWS CLI Cucumber vs WebTestClient Cucumber Parity

| Dimension | Legacy WebTestClient Cucumber | Phase 2 WebTestClient requirements | AWS CLI Cucumber |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scenarios | 239 passed | 11 total: 7 passed, 4 `@awscli` examples excluded/skipped | 26 existing parity scenarios passed; 4 dedicated Phase 2 storage-engine AWS CLI scenarios/examples passed |
| Tag / runner | `@webclient` | Isolated Phase 2 runner | `@awscli` |
| Driver | Spring WebTestClient | Spring WebTestClient | `aws s3api` CLI |
| Status | Passing | Implemented-and-validated for WebTestClient-required Phase 2 scope, including interrupted-write fault injection, corruption detection, recovery scanning, and concurrency | Object CRUD, bucket operations, metadata/tagging, multipart increments, and declared Phase 2 storage-engine AWS CLI examples passing; full parity incomplete beyond those scopes |
| Parity goal | Canonical suite | Maintain Phase 2 coverage and keep shared requirement text as source of truth | Must continue toward broader parity where AWS CLI can express the same behavior (roadmap item P3/S3-P1+) |

## Route-Level S3 Operation Coverage

> ⚠️ The table below documents which S3 operations have routes mapped and appear in `test-aws-cli.sh`.
> **A ✅ here means the route exists and the CLI script invokes it — it does NOT mean the operation is semantically implemented.**
> Most operations failed during the 2026-06-05 standalone run because the server was not running (exit code 254 = connection refused).

### Route and Script Coverage (formerly: "Implemented S3 Operation Coverage")

> Renamed to reflect actual meaning: **route mapped + script invoked ≠ semantically implemented.**

### Cucumber AWS CLI Test Status

| Category | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Legacy `@webclient` scenarios (239) | ✅ Passing | Existing Cucumber via Java WebTestClient. |
| Phase 2 WebTestClient requirements | ✅ 11 total, 7 passed, 4 `@awscli` examples excluded/skipped | REQ-FS-001 through REQ-FS-006 WebTestClient-required scope passes, including interrupted-write fault injection, corruption detection, recovery scanning, and concurrency scenarios. |
| Phase 2 storage-engine AWS CLI requirements | ✅ 4 total, 4 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped | Dedicated Phase 2 AWS CLI validation passes for REQ-FS-003, REQ-FS-004, REQ-FS-006 different keys, and REQ-FS-006 same key. |
| `@awscli` scenarios | ⚠️ 26 existing parity scenarios, all run, 0 skipped | Object CRUD basics (including slash-containing keys), bucket operations parity (create, list, head, location, versioning, delete, and failure cases), ACL/tagging (bucket and object), object attributes, and multipart upload lifecycle (initiate/upload/complete/abort/list) pass; full parity with `@webclient` canonical suite remains open beyond the declared Phase 2 AWS CLI scope (roadmap item P3/S3-P1+). |
| `test-aws-cli.sh` standalone | ⚠️ 46/82 passed | Independent script; most failures are connection errors (server not started at test time). |

## Roadmap

Operations not yet semantically implemented are tracked in `PLAN.md` under the *S3 API Semantic Completion Plan* (S3-P0 through S3-P4).
